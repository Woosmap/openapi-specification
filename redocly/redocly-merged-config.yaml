          # Transit API
          'transit':
            name: 'Transit API'
            description: |
              The Transit API delivers comprehensive public transportation routing information by calculating optimal travel paths between 
              origins and destinations. It provides detailed route data including distance, duration, polyline visualization, 
              and complete step-by-step transit instructions with transfer points and transportation modes. The API is ideal for 
              applications requiring accurate public transit navigation and trip planning capabilities.

          # Indoor API
          'Indoor API':
            name: 'Indoor API'
            description: |
              The Indoor API suite provides comprehensive tools for indoor mapping, search, and navigation in complex venues.
              
              The Indoor Map API renders detailed floor plans with customizable styling, while the Indoor Search API enables
              precise location searching through an intelligent POI engine with autocompletion capabilities.
              
              For wayfinding, the Indoor Distance API calculates optimal routes between indoor points, delivering polylines
              and turn-by-turn instructions. Advanced features include custom routing profiles for different user types
              (staff, visitors, etc.) and seamless integration with external systems.

          # Woosmap for what3words API
          'what3words':
            name: 'Woosmap for what3words API'
            description: |
              The Woosmap for what3words integration enhances location search capabilities by incorporating what3words' unique
              3-word addressing system. 
              
              This API is a drop in replacement of what3words API but hosted on Woosmap Platform, with the addition of an endpoint leveraging the power of 
              [Localities API](#tag/Woosmap_Platform_API_Reference_Localities-API) to convert a what3words address into a street address, bringing address level accuracy to what3words.

          # Datasets API
          'dataset':
            name: 'Datasets API'
            description: |
              The Datasets API enables you to store, manage, and analyze geospatial data collections. Work with custom datasets containing points, lines, or polygons - with each feature defined by its geometry and properties.
              
              * Create and manage datasets from uploaded Shapefile data
              * Import data from external sources via URL or scheduled updates
              * Monitor dataset status and processing through detailed status reports
              * Schedule dataset deletion for proper data lifecycle management
              * Leverage high accuracy storage for location-dependent business processes
              
              Ideal for applications that require precise location analysis, spatial queries and geographic data management.

          'search':
            name: 'Datasets API - Search'
            description: |
              Perform powerful spatial analysis on your geospatial data with four key search capabilities:
              
              * Nearby search: Find features within a specified distance from a location
              * Contains search: Discover which features completely contain a point or geometry
              * Intersects search: Identify features that intersect with a given geometry
              * Within search: Locate features that fall entirely inside a specified boundary
              
              All operations support attribute filtering with WHERE clauses, pagination for large results, and multiple geometry formats (GeoJSON, WKB, encoded polylines).

          'features':
            name: 'Datasets API - Features'
            description: |
              Access and retrieve individual geographic features from your datasets by their unique ID. This endpoint provides direct access to the complete geometry and properties of specific features within your datasets.
              
              The API supports field masking to optimize response size by retrieving only needed attributes. Output formats include both GeoJSON and WKB, allowing flexible integration with various mapping and analysis systems.

          'static':
            name: 'Static Map API'
            description: |
              The Woosmap Static Maps API lets you generate customizable, embeddable map images using simple HTTP requests. It’s a lightweight alternative to interactive maps—ideal for emails, reports, or websites where dynamic JavaScript maps aren't needed.  

              You provide parameters such as location, zoom level, size, and markers, and the API returns a map image that can be embedded directly into any webpage or application.
