<h2 id="required-parameters">Required parameters</h2>

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="input">input</h3>

    The text string on which to search, for example: "london" or "123 Cross Road".
    The Woosmap Localities API will return predictions matches based on this string and order the results based on their perceived relevance.
    To protect against illegitimate requests, only the 20 first tokens found in the first 150 characters will be used.

<h2 id="optional-parameters">Optional parameters</h2>

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="components">components</h3>

    A grouping of places to which you would like to restrict your results. Components can and should be used when applicable to filter over countries and retrieve more accurate results. Countries must be passed as an ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2 or Alpha-3 compatible country code. For example: `components=country:fr` or `components=country:fra` would restrict your results to places within France and `components=country:fr-fr` returns locations only in Metropolitan France. Multiple countries must be passed as multiple `country:XX` filters, with the pipe character (`|`) as a separator. For example: `components=country:gb|country:fr|country:be|country:sp|country:it` would restrict your results to city names or postal codes within the United Kingdom, France, Belgium, Spain and Italy.

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="custom_description">custom_description</h3>

    This parameter allows to choose the description format for all or some of the suggestion types selected. The custom formats are described as follows (available fields depend on the returned type): `custom_description=type_A:"{field_1}, {field_2}, [...]"|type_B:"{field_1}, {field_2}, [...]"`

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="data">data</h3>

    Two values for this parameter: `standard` or `advanced`. By default, if the parameter is not defined, value is set as `standard`. The `advanced` value opens suggestions to worldwide postal codes in addition to postal codes for Western Europe. ***A dedicated option subject to specific billing on your license is needed to use this parameter. Please contact us if you are interested in using this parameter and you do not have subscribed the proper option yet.***

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="excluded_types">excluded_types</h3>

    The types of suggestion to exclude. Multiple types can be passed using the pipe character (`|`) as a separator.

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="extended">extended</h3>

    If set, this parameter allows a refined search over locality names that bears the same postal code. By triggering this parameter, integrators will benefit from a search spectrum on the `locality` type that ***includes postal codes***. To avoid confusion, it is recommended not to activate this parameter along with the `postal_code` type which could lead to duplicate locations. Also, the default description returned by the API changes to `name (postal code), admin_1, admin_0`. It is only available for France, Monaco, Italy, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg.

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="language">language</h3>

    The language code, using ISO 639-2 Alpha-2 country codes, indicating in which language the results should be returned, if possible. If language is not supplied, first `Accept-Language` of the browser will be used.  If neither the provided `language` or the `Accept-Language` are known, the Localities service uses the international default language (English).  No `language` is necessary for a postal_code request. According to requested language, only parts of the address components might be translated.

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="location">location</h3>

    This parameter is used to add a geographical bias to the query. The location defines the point around which to retrieve results in priority. It must be specified in the `latitude,longitude` string format.

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="radius">radius</h3>

    This parameter may be used in addition to the `location` parameter to define the distance in meters within which the API will return results in priority. Results outside of the defined area may still be displayed. Default radius if this parameter is not set is 100 000.

-   <h3 class="parameter-name" id="types">types</h3>

    Specifies the types of suggestions to return in the query. Multiple types can be combined using the pipe character (`|`) as a separator. This parameter supports a wide range of locality classifications, including: - Standard locality types (e.g., cities, administrative areas, postal codes) - Points of Interest (POI) categories - POI aliases These classifications enable flexible geographic data representation and querying.
