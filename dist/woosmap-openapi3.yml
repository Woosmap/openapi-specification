  title: Woosmap Platform API Reference
  description: |
    The Woosmap API is a RESTful API built on HTTP. It has predictable resource URLs. It returns HTTP response codes to indicate errors. It also accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body. You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Woosmap's API, or you can use one of our Javascript SDKs for supported APIs:
      - [Map JS](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/map-api/get-started/) - support All APIs
      - [Localities JS](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/localities/localities-jsapi/get-started/) - for Localities API
      - [MultiSearch JS](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/multisearch-lib/js/get-started/) - for Localities API and Store Search API

    You can use Postman to test the API (if you use the `PUBLIC_API_KEY` authentication, don't forget to set the `Referer` Header corresponding to one of your restricted domain name).

      Stores Search API lets you query the Assets which are returned as a [GeoJson](https://geojson.org/). Request is done over HTTPS using GET. You must specify a key in your request, included as the value of a `key` parameter for your public key or `private_key` for your private key. This key identifies your application for purposes of quota management. Learn how to [get a key](https://developers.woosmap.com/support/api-keys/). If your request returns a high number of assets, the result will be paginated. If so, you can request assets by page using `page` and `stores_by_page` parameters (Default is **100**, max is **300**).

  - name: Data Management API
    description: |
      The Data Management API is a web service that uses an HTTP request to manage, create or edit your Assets. The API only supports JSON. So you have to create a JSON file with your assets’ addresses and other information. You’ll need to convert, or geocode, the addresses in your file to latitude/longitude (`lat` / `long`) coordinates. Those coordinates will be used for most of Woosmap features like [local searches](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/search-api/get-started/), [stores nearby a user location](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/geolocation-api/stores/) or for displaying markers on a map with [Woosmap Javascript API](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/js-api/get-started/).

  - name: Geolocation API
    description: |
      Geolocation API returns a location (or nearby stores) and accuracy radius based on an IP address. Request is done over HTTPS using GET. Response is formatted as JSON. You must specify a key in your request, included as the value of a `key` parameter for your public key or `private_key` for your private key. This key identifies your application for purposes of quota management. Learn how to [get a key](https://developers.woosmap.com/support/api-keys/).

  - name: Localities API
    description: |
      Woosmap Localities API is a web service that returns a great amount of geographical places in response to an HTTP request. Among others are city names, postal codes, suburbs, addresses or airports. Request is done over HTTPS using GET. Response is formatted as JSON. You must specify a key in your request, included as the value of a `key` parameter for your public key or `private_key` for your private key. This key identifies your application for purposes of quota management. Learn how to [get a key](https://developers.woosmap.com/support/api-keys/).

  - name: Address API
    description: |
      Woosmap Address API is a web service that returns addresses and other geographical places in response to an HTTP request. Request is done over HTTPS using GET. Response is formatted as JSON. You must specify a key in your request, included as the value of a `key` parameter for your public key or `private_key` for your private key. This key identifies your application for purposes of quota management. Learn how to [get a key](https://developers.woosmap.com/support/api-keys/).

  - name: Zones API
    description: |
      Woosmap Zones API is a web service that uses an HTTP request to manage, create or edit your Zones (polygons) attached to your assets.
      The general principle is that sometimes searching assets using crowfly distance is not good enough. For example to search the restaurant that will do the delivery for a specified address, each restaurant has a delivery zone and for topological or business reasons it’s not always the nearest restaurant in charge of your delivery. Woosmap Zones API allows you to associate a delivery zone to each of the restaurants.

      description: |
        Search query combining one or more search clauses. Each search clause is made up of three parts structured as `field` `:` `operator` `value`. , e.g. `name:="My cool store"`
        ### Vocabulary

          - **Field**: attribute of the Store that is searched, e.g. the attribute `name` of the store.

          - **Operator**: test that is performed on the data to provide a match, e.g. `=`.
          Each field has a default operator. If none operator follow the `:`, the default one is used.

          - **Value**: the content of the attribute that is tested, e.g. the name of the store `"My cool store"`.

        Combine clauses with the conjunctions `AND` or `OR`, and negate the query with `NOT`.
        ### Fields

          - `type`: An element is contained within `type` collection. e.g. `type:"myType"`

          - `tag`: An element is contained within `tag` collection. e.g. `tag:"myTag"`

          - `city`: text matching: the value match the `city` field. e.g. `city:="Paris"`

          - `country`: text matching: the value match the `countryCode` field. e.g. `country:="FR"`

          - `name`: text matching: the value match the `name` field. e.g. `name:="myName"`

          - `idstore`: text matching: the value match the `idstore` field.  e.g. `idstore:="myIdStore"`

          - `user`: concerns all fields inside `user_properties`. text matching or numerical comparison.  e.g. `user.myAttribute:="myValue"`

          - `localized`: used for [localizedNames](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/data-api/data-structure/#localizednames) to search in native language. text matching in collection: the value match one of the the `localizedNames`. e.g. `localized:="centro"`

        > **userProperties** field has no restriction regarding the data you can put in it (Arrays, Object, Boolean, String, Numeric...) but you can only query for **text matching or numerical comparison**.
        ### Operators

          - `:` : Default and mandatory operator. For `type` and `tag` fields, define that an element is contained within a collection.

          - `=` : The content of a string or a number is equal to the other.

          - `>` : A number is greater than another.

          - `<` : A number is smaller than another.

          - `>=` : A number is greater than or equal to another.

          - `<=` : A number is smaller than or equal to another.

          - `AND` : Return assets that match both clauses.

          - `OR` : Return assets that match either clauses.

          - `NOT` : Negates a search clause.

        For compound clauses, you can use parentheses to group clauses together. For example: ```(type:"type1" OR type:"type2") AND tag:"hockey"```
        You can use `NOT` operator to negates a search clause. For example: ```not type:"type1"```

            Specifies additional data about the geocoded location. The following values are currently supported: 
              - `ROOFTOP` result is a precise geocode for which we have location information accurate down to street address precision.
              - `RANGE_INTERPOLATED` result reflects an approximation (usually on a road) interpolated between two precise points (such as intersections). Interpolated results are generally returned when rooftop geocodes are unavailable for a street address.
              - `GEOMETRIC_CENTER` result is the geometric center of a result such as a polyline (for example, a street) or polygon (city, region, …).
              - `APPROXIMATE` result is approximate (usually when no other above value applies)
