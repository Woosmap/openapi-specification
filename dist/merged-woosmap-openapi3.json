It also accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body. You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to use Woosmap's API, or you can use one of our Javascript SDKs for supported APIs:\n  - [Map JS](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/map-api/get-started/) - support All APIs\n  - [Localities JS](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/localities/localities-jsapi/get-started/) - for Localities API\n  - [MultiSearch JS](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/multisearch-lib/js/get-started/) - for Localities API and Store Search API\n\nYou can use Postman to test the API (if you use the `PUBLIC_API_KEY` authentication, don't forget to set the `Referer` Header corresponding to one of your restricted domain name).\n\n[![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)](https://god.gw.postman.com/run-collection/18437534-dad12f37-6d84-42d1-9889-2f529aee0ab9?action=collection%2Ffork&source=rip_markdown&collection-url=entityId%3D18437534-dad12f37-6d84-42d1-9889-2f529aee0ab9%26entityType%3Dcollection%26workspaceId%3Dff0698d5-c4db-403e-b7c6-b622b68032d3)\n",

Each search clause is made up of three parts structured as `field` `:` `operator` `value`. , e.g. `name:=\"My cool store\"`\n### Vocabulary\n\n  - **Field**: attribute of the Store that is searched, e.g. the attribute `name` of the store.\n\n  - **Operator**: test that is performed on the data to provide a match, e.g. `=`.\n  Each field has a default operator. If none operator follow the `:`, the default one is used.\n\n  - **Value**: the content of the attribute that is tested, e.g. the name of the store `\"My cool store\"`.\n\nCombine clauses with the conjunctions `AND` or `OR`, and negate the query with `NOT`.\n### Fields\n\n  - `type`: An element is contained within `type` collection. e.g. `type:\"myType\"`\n\n  - `tag`: An element is contained within `tag` collection. e.g. `tag:\"myTag\"`\n\n  - `city`: text matching: the value match the `city` field. e.g. `city:=\"Paris\"`\n\n  - `country`: text matching: the value match the `countryCode` field. e.g. `country:=\"FR\"`\n\n  - `name`: text matching: the value match the `name` field. e.g. `name:=\"myName\"`\n\n  - `idstore`: text matching: the value match the `idstore` field.  e.g. `idstore:=\"myIdStore\"`\n\n  - `user`: concerns all fields inside `user_properties`. text matching or numerical comparison.  e.g. `user.myAttribute:=\"myValue\"`\n\n  - `localized`: used for [localizedNames](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/data-api/data-structure/#localizednames) to search in native language. text matching in collection: the value match one of the the `localizedNames`. e.g. `localized:=\"centro\"`\n\n> **userProperties** field has no restriction regarding the data you can put in it (Arrays, Object, Boolean, String, Numeric...) but you can only query for **text matching or numerical comparison**.\n### Operators\n\n  - `:` : Default and mandatory operator. For `type` and `tag` fields, define that an element is contained within a collection.\n\n  - `=` : The content of a string or a number is equal to the other.\n\n  - `>` : A number is greater than another.\n\n  - `<` : A number is smaller than another.\n\n  - `>=` : A number is greater than or equal to another.\n\n  - `<=` : A number is smaller than or equal to another.\n\n  - `AND` : Return assets that match both clauses.\n\n  - `OR` : Return assets that match either clauses.\n\n  - `NOT` : Negates a search clause.\n\nFor compound clauses, you can use parentheses to group clauses together. For example: ```(type:\"type1\" OR type:\"type2\") AND tag:\"hockey\"```\nYou can use `NOT` operator to negates a search clause. For example: ```not type:\"type1\"```\n"
