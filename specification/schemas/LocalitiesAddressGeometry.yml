      Specifies additional data about the geocoded location. The following values are currently supported: 
        - `ROOFTOP` result is a precise geocode for which we have location information accurate down to street address precision.
        - `RANGE_INTERPOLATED` result reflects an approximation (usually on a road) interpolated between two precise points (such as intersections). Interpolated results are generally returned when rooftop geocodes are unavailable for a street address.
        - `GEOMETRIC_CENTER` result is the geometric center of a result such as a polyline (for example, a street) or polygon (city, region, â€¦).
        - `APPROXIMATE` result is approximate (usually when no other above value applies)
        - `POSTAL_CODE` Address has inherited from the location of the postal code it is part of (for NYB addresses)
        - `DISTRICT` Address has inherited from the location of the district it is part of (for NYB addresses)
