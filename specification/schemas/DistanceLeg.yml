  start_location:
    description: The latitude/longitude coordinates of the origin of this leg. Because the Distance Route API calculates directions between locations by using the nearest transportation option (usually a road) at the start and end points, `start_location` may be different than the provided origin of this leg if, for example, a road is not near the origin.

  end_location:
    description: The latitude/longitude coordinates of the given destination of this leg. Because the Distance Route API calculates directions between locations by using the nearest transportation option (usually a road) at the start and end points, `end_location` may be different than the provided destination of this leg if, for example, a road is not near the destination.

  steps:
    description: List of steps constituting the leg. Steps are returned when `details=full` parameter is specified. A step is the most atomic unit of a route, containing a single step describing a specific, single instruction on the journey. The step not only describes the instruction but also contains distance and duration information relating to how this step relates to the following step.
