  description: >
    The Woosmap API is a RESTful API built on HTTP. It has predictable resource URLs. It returns HTTP response codes to
    indicate errors. It also accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body. You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your
    programming language to use Woosmap's API, or you can use one of our Javascript SDKs for supported APIs:
      - [Map JS](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/map-api/get-started/) - support All APIs
      - [Localities JS](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/localities/localities-jsapi/get-started/) - for Localities API
      - [MultiSearch JS](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/multisearch-lib/js/get-started/) - for Localities API and Store Search API

    You can use Postman to test the API (if you use the `PUBLIC_API_KEY` authentication, don't forget to set the `Referer` Header corresponding to one of your restricted domain name).

  - name: Store Search API
    description: >
      Stores Search API lets you query the Assets which are returned as a [GeoJson](https://geojson.org/).
      Request is done over HTTPS using GET.
      You must specify a key in your request, included as the value of a `key` parameter for your public key or `private_key` for your private key.
      This key identifies your application for purposes of quota management. Learn how to [get a key](https://developers.woosmap.com/support/api-keys/).
      If your request returns a high number of assets, the result will be paginated. If so, you can request assets by page using `page` and `stores_by_page` parameters (Default is **100**, max is **300**).

  - name: Data Management API
    description: >
      The Data Management API is a web service that uses an HTTP request to manage, create or edit your Assets.
      The API only supports JSON. So you have to create a JSON file with your assets’ addresses and other
      information. You’ll need to convert, or geocode, the addresses in your file to latitude/longitude (`lat` / `long`)
      coordinates. Those coordinates will be used for most of Woosmap features like [local searches](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/search-api/get-started/),
      [stores nearby a user location](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/geolocation-api/stores/) or for displaying markers on a map with
      [Woosmap Javascript API](https://developers.woosmap.com/products/js-api/get-started/).

      Geolocation API returns a location (or nearby stores) and accuracy radius based on an IP address.
      Request is done over HTTPS using GET. Response is formatted as JSON.

      Request is done over HTTPS using GET. Response is formatted as JSON.
      You must specify a key in your request, included as the value of a `key` parameter for your public key or `private_key` for your private key.

  - name: Zones API
    description: >
      Woosmap Zones API is a web service that uses an HTTP request to manage, create or edit your Zones (polygons) attached to your assets.
      
      The general principle is that sometimes searching assets using crowfly distance is not good enough.
      For example to search the restaurant that will do the delivery for a specified address, each restaurant has a delivery zone and for topological or business reasons it’s not always the nearest restaurant in charge of your delivery.
      Woosmap Zones API allows you to associate a delivery zone to each of the restaurants.
