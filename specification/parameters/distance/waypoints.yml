description: >
  A list of points by which the route should pass (route response is divided into legs, one leg corresponding to a route between two waypoints). Waypoints should be separated by `|` character.  

  Optionally, you may pass `optimize:true` as the first argument within the `waypoints` parameter. This way the provided route is optimized by rearranging the waypoints in a more efficient order based on distance or time according to the method parameter. The route start point and end point order is not changed, their position is considered fixed.  
  
  `alternatives` and `waypoints` can not be used at the same time.
