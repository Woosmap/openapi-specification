  Specify the types of geocoding responses to return by separating multiple types with a pipe character (|). 
  Specifies the types of suggestions to return in the query. Multiple types can be combined using the pipe character (`|`) as a separator.
  This parameter is ignored when used with the `latlng` parameter. 
  When executing a geocode request with the `address` parameter, this parameter supports a wide range of locality classifications, including:
    - Standard locality types (e.g., cities, administrative areas, postal codes)
    - Points of Interest (POI) categories
    - POI aliases

  These classifications enable flexible geographic data representation and querying.
