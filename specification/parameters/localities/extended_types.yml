name: types
description: >
  The types of points of interest to return. 
  Not specifying any types will not filter returned results and will default to the global `point_of_interest`. Please make sure this matches your use case as this behavior might not be efficient. 
  Multiple types can be passed using the pipe character (`|`) as a separator.
  For example: `types=business.shop|medical.pharmacy|business.finance.bank`.
