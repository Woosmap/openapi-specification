## Development

The repository makes use of [Bazel](https://bazel.build/) to generate outputs from the specification and sample
requests.

### Build and test

To be able to build the spec locally, you'll need a github personal access token (mandatory for merging with auto
generated spec such as Woosmap x What3Words).
Generate one with repository access here: <https://github.com/settings/tokens>.
To be able to generate responses, you'll need a woosmap public key and woosmap private key.
Once generated, it's convenient to add these environment variables in the file `.bazelrc.user` at the root of the
repository like this:

```bash
build --action_env GH_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxx
run --action_env WOOSMAP_PUBLIC_API_KEY=woos-xxxxxxxx
run --action_env WOOSMAP_PRIVATE_API_KEY=da4e8e73-xxxxx-xxxx
```

Then you'll be able to execute following command.

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run build`

   This generates the following outputs in the dist folder:

    - YAML file containing OpenAPI3 specification
    - JSON file containing OpenAPI3 specification
    - Structure Markdown documents for specification objects
    - Code snippets in multiple languages for sample requests

   > **Note**: The `dist/` folder is included in this repo and should be updated with all changes.

   > **Note**: If a documentation item is not generated, be sure it is included
   in the appropriate index.yml file.

3. `npm run responses` (optional)
   > **Note**: This is an optional step requiring an API key. Set the `WOOSMAP_PUBLIC_API_KEY`
   and `WOOSMAP_PRIVATE_API_KEY` environmental variable before running.

   > **Warning**: Data attached to the `WOOSMAP_PRIVATE_API_KEY` will be deleted. Use an empty test project for this.

   > **Note**: This step only needs to run when the generation code or sample requests have been updated.

   > **Note**: A single response can be updated similar to `npm run responses -- --only woosmap_http_address_details`.

4. `npm run samples` (optional)

   > **Note**: Generates snippets from requests to be integrated as xCodeSamples in path schemas.

5. `npm run test`
